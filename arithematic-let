let is a builtin function of Bash that allows us to do simple arithmetic. It follows the basic format:

let <arithmetic expression>

The arithmetic expression can take a variety of formats which we'll outline below. The first part is generally always a variable which the result is saved into however.

Let's look at a simple example:
let_example.sh

    #!/bin/bash
    # Basic arithmetic using let
    let a=5+4
    echo $a # 9
    let "a = 5 + 4"
    echo $a # 9
    let a++
    echo $a # 10
    let "a = 4 * 5"
    echo $a # 20
    let "a = $1 + 30"
    echo $a # 30 + first command line argument

Let's break it down:

    Line 4 - This is the basic format. Note that if we don't put quotes around the expression then it must be written with no spaces.
    Line 7 - This time we have used quotes which allow us to space out the expression to make it more readable.
    Line 10 - This is a shorthand for increment the value of the variable a by 1. It is the same as writing "a = a + 1".
    Line 16 - We may also include other variables in the expression.

    ./let_example.sh 15
    9
    9
    10
    20
    45

Here is a table with some of the basic expressions you may perform. There are others but these are the most commonly used.
Operator 	Operation
+, -, \*, / 	addition, subtraction, multiply, divide
var++ 	Increase the variable var by 1
var-- 	Decrease the variable var by 1
% 	Modulus (Return the remainder after division)
