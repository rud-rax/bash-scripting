This isn't really arithmetic but it can be quite useful. If you want to find out the lengh of a variable (how many characters) you can do the following:

${#variable}

Here's an example:
length_example.sh

    #!/bin/bash
    # Show the length of a variable.
    a='Hello World'
    echo ${#a} # 11
    b=4953
    echo ${#b} # 4

    ./length_example.sh
    11
    4
